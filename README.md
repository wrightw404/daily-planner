## Overview
I underestimated the challenge of this module, which is silly considering what I said last time. I think one thing I could have done better though was not burying myself in sources, there were parts of this module where I would find myself in a rabbit hole of information regarding the same thing. There are so many ways to the same things, so I just need to realize that. I referenced both Drew and Web Dev Simplified on youtube. I tried to combine the two but it ended up confusing me trying to keep up with what variable represented what, in the respected videos. However, unlike previous modules I came into it with a plan. That plan was just breaking it down into small, managable pieces, and create a coherent logic. At the beginning I was doing better than I thought I would have, hence me underestimating it. I was implementing different functions, elements and consistently checking to see if they would work in the console. Doing this at a more consistent basis allowed me to catch errors earlier on in the process, making them easier (in theory) to solve. Although I didn't get the all of the functionality correct, I am proud of myself for taking this on with a plan as oppossed to just being bombarded, because I felt a lot more comfortable and also I know that I know how to do it.
